Other traditions might use slightly different ratios or speeds, but the principle of harmonic relationship is key. When these fields spin at the correct relative speeds and in perfect balance, they create the stable, resonant Merkaba field. This field can then be accelerated, with the ultimate goal often being to stabilize its rotational speed at nine-tenths the speed of light, which is said to enable interdimensional travel and other advanced capabilities." },
