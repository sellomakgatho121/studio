# **App Name**: Lightbody Lexica

## Core Features:

- Content Rendering: Display all content from the Ascension Glossary 'Lightbody' page including text, images, and embedded media.
- Hyperlink Navigation: Categorize and display hyperlinks from the original page, leading to other relevant pages within the app.
- Fluid Animations: Implement fluid transitions and animations for a smooth, engaging user experience while navigating the content and links.
- AI-Driven Recommendations: An AI-powered 'Deep Dive' tool suggests other sections of text within the glossary (outside of the main 'Lightbody' article) that will provide a better understanding of particular concepts or vocabulary words, incorporating user context and semantic similarity analysis of the original article.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#D1B0FF) to evoke spirituality and tranquility.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F0F0), near white, for readability and focus on the content.
- Accent color: Muted teal (#70A1AF) for interactive elements and highlights, providing a subtle contrast.
- Body font: 'Alegreya', serif, to ensure readability and a pleasant reading experience, suitable for body text and headlines.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets, should it be present in any link in glossary.
- Use minimalist, line-art style icons for navigation and content categories. Each icon should have a translucent aura of lavender, and when the user activates it, it should have a satisfying radial expansion animation, also in lavender.
- Incorporate subtle parallax scrolling effects and fade-in animations for content loading to enhance the immersive experience.
